# Diagnosing Model Performance Under Distribution Shift

This repository contains a reproduction of the research [Diagnosing Model Performance Under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02011). Please note that this is not an official repository maintained by the original authors.



## Overviwe
In this reproduction, we aim to recreate the experiments and results reported in the original research paper. We follow the methodology described in the paper as closely as possible, using the similar dataset, parameters, and evaluation metrics.

The repository contains code for reproducing the experiments in the paper. All reproducible experiments are available in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Specifically, it includes:
- [x] 4.1.1 Y | X shift: missing/unobserved covariates
- [x] 4.1.2 X shift: selection bias in age



## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this repository, such as bug fixes or enhancements to the code. Please create a pull request with your changes, and we will review them as soon as possible.


## Contact
If you have any questions or want to use the code, please contact `yoontae@unist.ac.kr`.
